2016.2.1 ~ 2016.2.5, i had the pleasure of attending my first linux.conf.au. This year it took place in Geelong, a very beautiful, small, seaside city, about an hour train ride southwest of Melbourne. I arrived Melbourne on Sunday(1.31) afternoon and took the shuttle bus from Melbourne airport to the conference venue at Deakin University’s Waterfront Campus, after finished the registration and got my badge, then I walked to my hotel along the very beautiful beach.
