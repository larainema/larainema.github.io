FOSSASIA is the premier Free and Open Source technology organization in Asia for developers, designers, start-ups, and contributors. Projects at FOSSASIA range from open hardware, to design, graphics and software. FOSSASIA was established in 2009. The annual FOSSASIA took place in Cambodia, Vietnam and Singapore. FOSSASIA 2016 took place in Science Center Singapore.

I arrived Singapore on March 17th midnight and my hotel located in the downtown of Singapore, the Science Center Singapore located at the West of Singapore, so i need take the train early in the morning to get to the conference venue. The conference began on March 18 morning, i spent the whole morning at the main conference opening and keynotes.

With that, the conference came to a close with a closing session that included thanks to everyone.

I went to more talks than highlighted in this post, but with three days of conferencing it would have been a lot to cover. Huge thanks to all the organizers and everyone who made me feel so welcome this year. It was a wonderful presentation and conference experience and I hope to do it again next year!
