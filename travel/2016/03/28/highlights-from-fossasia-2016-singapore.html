<p>With that, the conference came to a close with a closing session that included thanks to everyone.</p>

<p>I went to more talks than highlighted in this post, but with three days of conferencing it would have been a lot to cover. Huge thanks to all the organizers and everyone who made me feel so welcome this year. It was a wonderful presentation and conference experience and I hope to do it again next year!</p>
